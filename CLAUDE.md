# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a new, empty project directory for learning PyWebView. The repository is currently empty and will likely be populated with Python examples and code for working with PyWebView - a Python library for building desktop applications using web technologies.

## Common Development Commands

Since this is a new project, standard Python development commands will likely include:

```bash
# Install dependencies (when requirements.txt exists)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Python applications (when Python files exist)
python <filename>.py

# Install PyWebView (not yet installed)
pip install pywebview
```

## Architecture Notes

This project is set up for learning PyWebView, which allows creating desktop applications with web-based UIs. Typical structure may include:
- Python files for application logic and PyWebView window management
- HTML/CSS/JS files for the user interface
- Static assets and resources

## Getting Started with PyWebView

Once code is added to this repository, you would typically:
1. Install PyWebView: `pip install pywebview`
2. Create Python files that define the application window and load HTML content
3. Run the Python application to launch the desktop window with web content

This repository is currently empty and ready for initial PyWebView learning examples to be added.
